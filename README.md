# engineering-llm
A collaborative repository documenting my learning journey with Large Language Models (LLMs) through insightful Datawhale open-source projects: llm-preview for initial exploration, self-llm for self-hosted capabilities, and happy-llm for advanced optimization and fine-tuning. Featuring practical code examples and hands-on notes.
